    "quote": "Happy 20th to one of the biggest blessings in my life :) Not only have I known you for like, 15/16 years (including R1), but the fact that we've grown up together and still learn from each other and are so real with one another – it's so rare and I treasure what we have so much. 2020 has been soo wild, but amidst all the chaos, I've learned to appreciate the little things. I'm grateful you bring me sour patch kids whenever you're back from the states (not 1 pack but like 500), that you always walk me to my bus stop and wait for the bus with me after we hang, that you check up on me everyday (and actually care when I'm sick), that we don't consistently use our phones when we're together, and so much more. You're not someone that I feel I have to prove myself to or act a certain way around, you're so incredibly supportive of me in everything that I do and I trust you so so much. Being by your side and just seeing how you treat others, how you forgive even when it's hard to, and how you've grown to prioritize self care (more), makes me genuinely happy.\nKeep being the workaholic that you are, doing what makes you happy, and being around people who are good to you. I'll be there every step of the way, I promise!!\nLove you and I'm so proud of you.\nHappy Birthday hehe\nTheresa xx"

As I wasn't familiar to the whole American high school system at first, it took a toll on me and I didn't balance out my courses in high school, which results in senior year being filled with very intense courses. I was overwhelmed by all the workload and pressure throughout the year, but I lied to myself and kept it from my friends and family by saying that I was okay. I guess that's one of the reasons I started drifting away from all my friends, I wasn't happy with my performance in classes and I thought maybe just taking my social part away would help the situation, but it got worse and I started getting very depressed and helpless. But even then, you still support me and make sure that I was doing just fine. And that really meant a lot to me, just knowing that you're always there when I needed help. I honestly don't know what would've happened if you weren't actually there for me in my senior year.\nTo be honest, I really hated high school, but you really made it a better place. I hope you know that I will be there if you need someone to talk, and I hope we keep in contact. Thank you for the past three years, I'm looking forward for more years to come ❤️"

He has become such a strong support system for myself, and many others, that the bond between us has become something like that of siblings. \nAlthough I’ve met many people throughout they years, no one compares to Edward. That is why he has become a role model for myself.\nHis love for people is something I envy. I still don’t understand how someone can be so compassionate. Being there for people in a supportive way is what Edward does better than anyone I have ever met. \n\nEdward always goes out of his way to help others even when he is facing challenges of his own. He puts others in front of himself because he is always seeking to lessen the pain of others.\nEdward is the perfect applicant. I am sure he will greatly benefit the program and community to the best of his abilities."

Thank you for supporting, loving, and caring for me every day. Thanks for inspiring me and making me laugh and supporting my every decision and trusting me + so much more.

I’m glad in a way I helped you but you gotta give yourself more credit too ok. You're such an amazing person, you're always there to help and even if things go so bad you never give up. You and Shikaar both made such a huge difference at HKIS. Honestly, and even if Christine and I are both not better right away I want you to know you’ve helped so much and I really don’t know how I would’ve been able to go through those last few days of school if it wasn’t for you.  And thank you for this message it means so much to me. ❤️ I’ll always remember everything you’ve done for me, my friends, and HKIS. HKIS wouldn’t ever be the same without u. Know that"

I honestly don't know how I would've survived these past few months if it wasn't for your help and all the advice you gave me. I was completely broken after the summer and battling depression / panic attacks were one of the hardest things I had to experience, and knowing you'd support me no matter what helped me so much. I have so much respect for ya and I really just want the best for you. I know you're gonna fact a lot more challenges in the future, but know that you're never alone and Christine and I will always be by your side, I promise you. Just like you said to us, you're not defined by the experiences you went through, it's who you become afterwards that matters the most. I've gone through a lot of friendship problems, a heartbreak, almost through college struggles, and constant parent arguments, if I can go through this, I know you'll be fine. And of course always take it easy. \nHappy New Year and 2020 will be good!\nAll the best, Kathy"

You went through a lot as well in the past and I'm always happy to help or give you advice so don't worry about it at all.\nAnd yeah, I think you also know I'm going through quite a rough time at the moment and I've definitely gotten better at suppressing but don't worry, I'm still somewhat aware of how I feel.\nIt just means so much that you're not gonna give up or get bored of me. I really really needed that after everything.\nI just don't have a lot of people that I trust and you and Dana are really the only two I do.

But truth is I think I need to start embracing it because having you guys and my other friends is honestly enough. I know my past pain is gonna come na dgo and there are days where it hits harder but that just made me realise having you guys mean so so much to me. I honestly don't know if I'm able to find even better people at college so I'm so so grateful for the friendship we have. \n\n💕💕\nAlso I just wanted to say, first of all you're such an amazing, talented, and truly special person. The fact that you haven't given up on me and you've listened to all my long ass rants...just thank you so so much for that. Really. I'm just going through a hardish time with my family at the moment and it means the world that I know I have your support.\n\nThe other thing I wanna say is I'm truly so proud and I have so much respect for you. You've been through so much at such a young age and the fact you decide to still help others is amazing. Idk I just don't know how you do it but I have so much love for you and I wish you nothing but the best.

I’m always here\n\nI know i can’t help u much or I kinda can but tahts why I invited u out today . I know it doesn’t do much but j wanted to show u that u are loved. Though they were  all originally  my friends now they are urs too. \nFor the past few weeks Dana has been talking about u actually. She says how amazing u are and how nice of a person u are. I know that may not do much but I want u to try to see through that barrier of loneliness. It’s not easy, it’s hard af but there’s a lot in life.\nWhat u went through and ur gonna go through isn’t easy at all. It’s not easy and no one should go through that but honestky look how far you’ve come . \nand even if you don’t wanna see how far you’ve gone, look how far I’ve gone. I went from this heartbroken insecure even pettier, stubborn girl to someone who has gained and is gaining self love. \nI mean it I wouldn’t be able to go through this without ur help . You Edward, you helped me. Not my therapist, not my mom . This amazing adult that I truly respect and look up to help bring kat back \nShe now accepts her flaws and is thriving,\nAnd I want u to know I hv so much respect for u. U know that.\nI care so much\nOk?\nI want u to read this and try ur very best to think past that barrier of loneliness. u can always count on josh me dana no matter what. These aren’t just my friends, they are ur friends now too. U don’t hv to be vulnerable to them but know we all care so much about u. \nyour amazing, worth it and deserve the world. You DONT need me to tell u that, and u know why? \nThat’s because the reason I’m not and never gonan leave u is cuz I love ur flaws and who u are as a person.\nof course. Sigh I know I can’t do much but I jsut want the best for u. Your someone so special and I think U don’t see that much. I hv sm love and faith in u and i hope one day you’ll see taht in yourself. \nto embrace your flaws\nThe other thing  I wanna say is I’m truly proud of u. I was thinking and i honestly can’t imagine how hard it must be having depression while living in a judgmental society where toxic masculinity and ego lives. I’m not a guy so I don’t know much but I do understand how it feels to have these emotions and if I already feel as if we live in such a judgmental society as a girl I don’t rly know how u do it ...\nI’m not saying this to bring u down and I’m not saying  there aren’t good  people in thsi world. It’s more about how proud I am of u.\nyou’ve come so far so don’t give up just yet. The future won’t be easy especially with the uncertainty but u hv people who care so much about u and I know its hard to see atm but there’s so much more to this. stay strong and I’ll always be here. \nI might not be ur gf or someone who talks to u 24/7 but I promise you I’m always here and a call away. you deserve the whole world and I don’t wnat u to forget that\n"

Sure you'e had a past that was unfortunate, and I'm sorry it's happened but all I can say is you've become such an amazing person because of that. You could've been petty, a total dick, instead you turned to help others and learn to love yourself. You're such an inspiration and I know I've said this way too many times but I really do have so much respect for you. You didn't give up on yourself when days are hard, when thoughts come and go and hit you in an instant. It's really easier said than done but you decided to face the problem. You didn't give up on yourself and still hoped and that's why I look up to you so much. You not only helped yourself but me too. I really hope 2020 will be even better for you and know it's completely okay to feel sad once in a while. Letting go is never easy and you'll always have my support.\n"

You've been there for me though thick and thin, and there's no one is rather be by my side. I honestly have no idea who or what I'd be if you weren't a part of my life.

I’m actually in a band in college now and got some new tricks up my sleeve for next time we jam 😉 I’m so glad you decided to choose that career path and glad I could help with that choice, and you equally helped me with growing myself as a person and pushing me to perform at my best, even at times where I don’t believe in myself, and for that I’m forever grateful."

You’re one of the most intelligent and caring of individuals I’ve ever met, and having you as a roommate to absorb wisdom and knowledge by osmosis has been one of the most beneficial things I’ve encountered in my life. \nThe reason why I trust you and open up is simple; you’re one of the best people to do that with, in fact it’s to my detriment not to if I didn’t. This is not something that can be said for a lot of people, making you rare, very rare indeed. Make sure you never lose your self for whatever reason, because the world needs more people like you, and it often will throw all sorts of obstacles at you to make you lose your way.\nI’m glad I can serve as a person that reminds you of who you would like to be, and my role in keeping you sharp. Thank goodness I can be myself and serve a useful purpose, because it’s often I feel that my real self has little value, hence the entire self growth progress this year. You were instrumental in it, I wouldn’t have achieved it without you and Ravi, and I’m grateful.\nAnd likewise, it’s been an awesome year of growth! Let’s tackle the next one serving our respective roles, and may we never forget who we would like to be in the process.\nHappy new decade Edward, and here’s to meaningful and successful years going ahead!"

Without you dude, I realy would have no idea whetehr I'd have gone through the first semester of college intact with the emotional turmoil caused by life and a certain flower....\n\nI've often cited why I look up to you but I'm doing it again lah. Your competence, intelligence, wisdom, and charisma are like someone rolled 20s in a d20 dice during charactercreation beofre a campaign, though I know they're forged by fire in your early experienced in life. I hope you're doing alright emotionally because holy crap man, you bring so much good to others.\n\nI'm glad to have met you. It's really just like the movies.

You make me feel so comfortable and loved and I just feel safe around you. I wish I could've been there for you more during all those years. I hate that you've had to go through so much and I hate that I wasn't there beside you. Again, I'm sorry that I'll probably go a bit MIA this next month during my finals but I want to be there fo ryou so tell me if something is wrong. \nAnd I miss you too. This year's been pretty stressful and I miss you a lot."

To be honestly I need to focus on my study rn as it's the last 3 weeks for me so I don't have the capacity to figure out how I feel about you at the moment but I promise to when I finish my hsc. All I know rn is that I care for you, Edward."

You've helped me through so much, and you're a big reason why I'm still in HK and I didn't give up n go back to SA.

These past 3 years have been the best in my entire life so far and you've been there by my side all the way. We've supported each other and so many others in the short time we've known each other. It has been an honor and a privilege to be at your side, to grow, change and mature with you. You are one of the most amazing people I konw, if not the most amazing person I know. I love you so much and I miss you already. Have an absolute blast in college, and don't forget me when you reach the top. Peace and love."

I know firsthand how much care can hurt, and how hard it is to care for someone who hurt you so much. In the end, you know that I'll never judge you for anything you choose to do. I'm in your corner, no matter what. But, know that it's precisely when love is the harder choice, that it's the one we should make, always\n\nAnd ofc you care too much, it's who we are. But despite the hurt, we keep going. Because its who we are. And I don't think that's going to change anytime soon"

Knowing that that's how I made you feel, just makes me so incredibly happy, because honestly at the time, all I wanted was to run as far away from the me that I left in SA as I possibly could. I was embarrassed, ashamed and frankly fed-up with the person I was. When I came to HK, I thought it would be a fresh start, but I never really got that until we became friends. You were the person that I judged myself by, and honestly, if I hadn't done that, I don't know where I'd be at all today. I never knew what I could be. I had no idea that I was an empath, I had no idea what my passions were, I had no idea of who I was. All I wanted to do was be something new, and our friendship is what motivated me to never give up. I never would've imagined that we'd both be where we are now, but despite everything along the way, I couldn't be happier to call you my best friend. My brother. My soulmate. I love you so much ed, when everyone and everything is falling apart, I know you'll always be there. There's no amount of text, no gesture grand enough, no words, to express how truly grateful I am to you. So thank you too ❤️ and I love you so much"

It's wild when I look back at Mrs Gill's bio class all those years ago.

    "quote": "Right, okay, I'm glad first of all that you're going to your counseling services, I'm really sad that you've been pus-ed to this point, but after all we preach, I think that it's a definitively a good choice. Also, it's really unfortunate that you're in the situation like that with your roommates...I know how that feels (honestly, I feel the same way with my friends here, you and Ryu are the ones I go to when anything bad happens) but I think you need a reminder that I'm only a call away ed, be it day or night, time difference and all, I will ALWAYS be here for you and care about you. I don't like seeing you struggle to keep your head over the waves, but I also think that there's a lot going on right now with you and you're stretched/stretching (hopefully not 😤♥️) yourself faaaaaar too thin. It's good that you rested on Monday, but honestly I think you're at the point where you NEED to take a few days off. Proper off. I'll handle all your people even, if you need me to😅 but I really think you're already burnt out, and running on fumes. I know because you're saying things that I was thinking when I was in that state earlier this year. I don't want you to sink ed. I need you. Many other people need you. But also, me or others shouldn't be the reason you're staying above the surface. It should be you. You should stand tall, and proud because of who you are. Because you're a healer, and a listener. There's always gonna be people that come in and out, jobs that change, cities you move to, but through all the ups and downs, you need to remember that the reason you're staying above the waves is because you help people. Because you've been below. And because you don't and can't allow anyone to see the darkness like you've seen it. You're stronger because of it, but you know not everyone can recover from it like we did. We're always working ed, and it's always okay to take a dip. We're human (despite our God complex's) and we fall sometimes. That's why we have eachother, and that's why I'm here for you ♥️ I know you'll be fine ed, because this will pass. You know it will too, but it's okay to be caught in it. Just rest, focus on you for a while, and then come back swinging ♥️ I love you man"

I get that you want to be there for your team, but look at it objectively, if you're already behind schedule, you're underexperienced (i'm assuming from what I read) and the boss creates a toxic environment (that I'm assuming is hard to work in). At this point, the only thing keeping you there is sunk cost fallacy. I know you waant to be there for your team, but would you really rather be there and be a determent because of the environment etc and at the cost of your mental health?\n\nWhat we do is tough ed, and sometimes, we make mistakes. As much as our God complexes don't want us to, we do. No one expects you to be perfect Ed, even though you're the best person I've ever met ❤️ You're not perfect. Neither am I. Christine knows this. I explained a lot to her that you're human, just like her. And I told her tot text you to tell you how she feels because she really wants to talk toyou and have you as her brother again.\nI get that you feel guilty, and that's good, so long as you learn from said guilt. I know you. You'd neve walk away from someone who needed you, unless someone else needed you more, and I think Kathy is still way more unstable than Christine. Be proud tha tyou helped Christine to the point where she can got rhough things in her own for the most part now. Again, I think you need time to fully rest and recover. Be patient with yourself, and don't be so judgemental of yourself❤️Drinking, lashing out, running away are all temporary solutions and you know that. \nTake time off, enjoy summer, frefresh your soul. I think you're severely burnt out ed 😕❤️I wish I was there in person so we could do something together❤️but for now, please rest yourself🙏 and text me if you need anything."

It's not easy to lead like this but you have a natural way of doing it, so I hope that you will find opportunities to continue in the future.\n\nI couldn't believe how hard everyone worked throughout the entire week! You were doing every task, encouraging everyone to work hard through your example and warm conversations. And of course you smile, which you wore throughout the week.\nI can't tell you how pleased I was to go on this experience with you and to see you blossom and help others blossom.\nYour aunt must be so proud to watch you do what you did.\nBest,\nMrs. Chi and Mr. Canham"
