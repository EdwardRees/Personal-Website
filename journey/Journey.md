## Timeline

### 2013

The True Beginning

Projects:

- [First website for Genius Hour](https://github.com/EdwardR5/EdwardRees.github.io/blob/master/static/ghp/original.html)
  - The first website I ever wrote. It was an experience to see what coding actually looked and felt like. Granted this was the first time, I didn't know how to host the website and ended up hosting it on my Computer locally. 

Languages:

- HTML
- CSS
- Basic JavaScript

### 2014

Playing around and trying out creating Mods for Minecraft

First Minecraft Mod

- [https://themodbros.wixsite.com/themodbros/downloads](https://themodbros.wixsite.com/themodbros/downloads)
  - My first experience working with typed programming, following YouTube tutorials and MinecraftForum tutorials. These weren't only one mod, but contained multiple: An Overpowered Scepter, Vanilla Plus (Adding more armors and tools to Vanilla), and a Game weapons mod (Skyrim, Infinity Blade, etc). It was really rudimentary coding and pretty cookie cutter, but definitely showed me how complicated programming can get.
