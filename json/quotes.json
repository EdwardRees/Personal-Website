Oh my goodness, this is such a huge milestone (even if it may not feel like it in the moment) but I'm soo proud of you for everything you've accomplished and I can't express how grateful that I have you in my life for the long run =) There are so many things that I appreciate about you and our friendship - to name a few .... \n- Daily texts / randomly checking up on each other \n- Spontaneous hangouts\n- Long walks\n- Your hardworking attitude and spirit\n- Your perserverance (spelled dat wrong)\n- the...no filter in our convos\n- your honesty\nand so much more =)\nCOVID was so unexpected and it gave rise to so many challenges - 2020 was rough... but we technically endured a year of uni together and I feel like it definitely strengthened the bond that we have =) no matter how much time goes by, our connection never really changes... It just gets stronger if anything. Our friendship is so valuable and important to me and I promise I'll always be here by your side to take on life's happiest moments and of course all the hardships too. I hope your 21st bday is as SPECIAL and awesome as you are, love ya and happy happy bday <3\n Tree xx"

I'm grateful you bring me sour patch kids whenever you're back from the states (not 1 pack but like 500), that you always walk me to my bus stop and wait for the bus with me after we hang, that you check up on me everyday (and actually care when I'm sick), that we don't consistently use our phones when we're together, and so much more. You're not someone that I feel I have to prove myself to or act a certain way around, you're so incredibly supportive of me in everything that I do and I trust you so so much. Being by your side and just seeing how you treat others, how you forgive even when it's hard to, and how you've grown to prioritize self care (more), makes me genuinely happy.\nKeep being the workaholic that you are, doing what makes you happy, and being around people who are good to you. I'll be there every step of the way, I promise!!\nLove you and I'm so proud of you.\nHappy Birthday hehe\nTheresa xx"

You may or may not be wondering what the purpose of this letter is (idk...up to you) and honestly, idk either. This letter will probably be me just ranting about how grateful I am to have you as an older brother. First of all, I would like to say thank you! Not only for being there for me for the past couple of years, but for also taking care of me. Words can't explain how grateful I am for such a considerate, supportive, and caring older brother.\n*Disclaimer:This letter will have no order/type of organisation whatsoever so this will be a mess but you're used to that as you have been dealing with me for a while.\n\nWe've known of each other's existence for 9 years (so since I was 7? idk) but we've gotten closer over the last two, which I feel is sad. Honestly, I don't know how you've dealt with me and my problems for so long because there is a lot, some of which are very much repeated...actually, all of them are very much repeated, so kudos to you<❤️ I also don't know how you've managed to come to basically all of my performances in the past two years. You've really encouraged me to continue performing and helping me to remember to BREATHE!\n\nYou help me feel needed and loved when I needed to the most. (I can't English...but that's nothing new). You've constantly reminded me that I have a reason to live for the long period of time that I've known you for, you've constantly made sure that I was doing okay. You've helped so many people and you deserve all the recognition that you get, I'm gonna end this letter here by saying a couple of words.\n\n-I'm gonna miss you like crazy\n-idk what I'm gonna do w/o you\n-I'm so lucky to call you my older brother\nand finally...I love you more than words can say and CONGRATULATIONS! You've achieved (idk if that's right) so much and I don't want you to give up! ❤️"

As I wasn't familiar to the whole American high school system at first, it took a toll on me and I didn't balance out my courses in high school, which results in senior year being filled with very intense courses. I was overwhelmed by all the workload and pressure throughout the year, but I lied to myself and kept it from my friends and family by saying that I was okay. I guess that's one of the reasons I started drifting away from all my friends, I wasn't happy with my performance in classes and I thought maybe just taking my social part away would help the situation, but it got worse and I started getting very depressed and helpless. But even then, you still support me and make sure that I was doing just fine. And that really meant a lot to me, just knowing that you're always there when I needed help. I honestly don't know what would've happened if you weren't actually there for me in my senior year.\nTo be honest, I really hated high school, but you really made it a better place. I hope you know that I will be there if you need someone to talk, and I hope we keep in contact. Thank you for the past three years, I'm looking forward for more years to come ❤️"

		"quote": "ed, you are someone that really tries your best in all types of things and relationships that you do. In this digitalised generation where everyone no longer treasures human connection or takes it for granted, you're one that didn't and that is a great thing in itself, but at the same time with the different ways people treat or handle relationships, you're easily vulnerable due to those treatment.\nThere's gonna be people who do not handle relationships nicely or take peoples kindness for granted, so I understand how you will get drained from putting in all the effort while the other party is solely taking. That is an unfair treatment itself, and if you feel that towards someone for some period, then they might not be treasuring the relationship as much as you do. Talk to them about it, make them understand how you feel and seek a common ground, but if they aren't willing to change, treat it same way as you do, then maybe they aren't people that you should be wasting time on.\nYou're a very kind person ed, and I get that you try to maintain friendships with a lot of different people, but some people are just not worth it and you need to know that. If they bring you down or distance you cause of small matters, take it as a red flag and leave those people, focus on people who are really there for you instead.\nAt the same time, I know it's hard to do in practice, but just try to understand yourself better. Just sit down, and think about your values, what you like or don't like, your boundaries, your goals in life, etc etc. It's important that you learn to love and respect yourself first, so you can protect yourself from mistreatment of other people. Love yourself ed. you're worthy of it.\nI know I'm quite late this time and I couldn't really be there this time but I'm willing to listen and talk ed, don't give up on yourself. You have a lot of great things in you, nkow your worth and leave  people that don't appreciate you behind :)"

		"quote": ":((( i’m so sorry that happened to you\nfor the first part, it’s hard to maintain or work on the friendship if you’re the only one reciprocating and trying to make it work. It goes for all relationships but it takes two to make things work, and you shouldn’t be too harsh on yourself. There might actually be ways to retain those relationships but you’re not the only one contributing to it, if you do really treasure those ppl and desperately want things to work out, you may reach out but sometimes relationships end you might have to accept it the way they are. That’s why we’re here for you ed, there’s definitely ppl like me here that are going to keep supporting you so try to focus on those you really treasure and remind yourself you’re definitely not alone\nfor the second part, some people are just careless with their words and they don’t know that their words might offend you. it might just be genuine curiosity and it can be frustrating for you when people don’t understand. As long as you know what you want and need in life, just try to ignore those comments and focus on yourself\ni relate a lot to the friends situation in the last part, there are people that i would consider as friends but i won’t never be able to engage in heartful conversations or trust with my thoughts. It’s sad honestly but not everyone is genuine and i’ve learnt to differentiate others from my true friends so I would lower my expectations and try not to get disappointed when they do not listen or care the way i do for them. that’s why friends like me are here for you ed, you know you’ll always have me to rely on and support you mentally❤️\nit might be a phase for some people, i definitely wasn’t as wholesome before but as people grow older, they’ll learn that what you did for them is irreplaceable but for now they just don’t understand\nfocus on the people that actually matter in your life or people that actually brings you positive energy, those are the ones that’ll be there when you’re going through though times and friends you’d know would last a lifetime\nnot everyone may understand you but keep the ones that do and you’ll be at a much happier place❤️❤️i hope you’ll be happier as time goes\nit’s cause you understand how important it is to listen and give support to others in need, but some people take your kindness for granted. I know you do enjoy being a counsellor and help others out, but it’s important to take breaks and find yourself someone that is willing listen to you as well. I think it’s cause it has happened to you quite often that makes you feel disappointed when some people aren’t there for you the same way you were there for them, and tbh if that other party keeps draining your energy and keeps abusing your kindness without giving, it’s safe to say that the relationship is toxic and itd be better that you stay out of it until you’re feeling better. There’s definitely people like me that are willing to listen and support you, but it’s not guaranteed that everyone would do the same in return of your support. try to stay away from the people that give you negative energy and recharge yourself from the people that do you good. It’ll definitely help you focus on the good in life and remind you of the support and care you actually deserve❤️\nand honestly don’t beat yourself up for reaching out that’s what friends are actually for, i definitely wouldn’t mind listening  and being there for you when that’s all i can do for you at the moment, we all need that person to support and be there for them when tough times call\nquit the negative ppl out of your life you’re better than that\nor just be mindful that they’re not worth your time being sad over and you’ll definitely save your energy for better things\ni love you and miss you too☺️\n\nit’ll take time to do so, just remember there’s better people out there and you’re not alone❤️"

It’s fine if you can’t seek that same comfort from ppl in SF, but don’t bottle up your emotions too much, if you’re burnt out and stressed you can always tell others, they may not be fully supportive but you’d feel less entrapped by the situation and it’ll make it a tiny bit endurable.

Though they were  all originally  my friends now they are urs too. \nFor the past few weeks Dana has been talking about u actually. She says how amazing u are and how nice of a person u are. I know that may not do much but I want u to try to see through that barrier of loneliness. It’s not easy, it’s hard af but there’s a lot in life.\nWhat u went through and ur gonna go through isn’t easy at all. It’s not easy and no one should go through that but honestky look how far you’ve come . \nand even if you don’t wanna see how far you’ve gone, look how far I’ve gone. I went from this heartbroken insecure even pettier, stubborn girl to someone who has gained and is gaining self love. \nI mean it I wouldn’t be able to go through this without ur help . You Edward, you helped me. Not my therapist, not my mom .

U know that.\nI care so much\nOk?\nI want u to read this and try ur very best to think past that barrier of loneliness. u can always count on josh me dana no matter what. These aren’t just my friends, they are ur friends now too. U don’t hv to be vulnerable to them but know we all care so much about u. \nyour amazing, worth it and deserve the world. You DONT need me to tell u that, and u know why? \nThat’s because the reason I’m not and never gonan leave u is cuz I love ur flaws and who u are as a person.\nof course. Sigh I know I can’t do much but I jsut want the best for u. Your someone so special and I think U don’t see that much. I hv sm love and faith in u and i hope one day you’ll see taht in yourself. \nto embrace your flaws\nThe other thing  I wanna say is I’m truly proud of u. I was thinking and i honestly can’t imagine how hard it must be having depression while living in a judgmental society where toxic masculinity and ego lives. I’m not a guy so I don’t know much but I do understand how it feels to have these emotions and if I already feel as if we live in such a judgmental society as a girl I don’t rly know how u do it ...\nI’m not saying this to bring u down and I’m not saying  there aren’t good  people in thsi world. It’s more about how proud I am of u.\nyou’ve come so far so don’t give up just yet. The future won’t be easy especially with the uncertainty but u hv people who care so much about u and I know its hard to see atm but there’s so much more to this. stay strong and I’ll always be here. \nI might not be ur gf or someone who talks to u 24/7 but I promise you I’m always here and a call away. you deserve the whole world and I don’t wnat u to forget that\n"

Yo see how far we've both come, it makes me so proud, and so privileged to call you my best friend ♥️I love you so much, and I'll stop there cuz I also have something planned for new years too"

Also, it's really unfortunate that you're in the situation like that with your roommates...I know how that feels (honestly, I feel the same way with my friends here, you and Ryu are the ones I go to when anything bad happens) but I think you need a reminder that I'm only a call away ed, be it day or night, time difference and all, I will ALWAYS be here for you and care about you. I don't like seeing you struggle to keep your head over the waves, but I also think that there's a lot going on right now with you and you're stretched/stretching (hopefully not 😤♥️) yourself faaaaaar too thin. It's good that you rested on Monday, but honestly I think you're at the point where you NEED to take a few days off. Proper off. I'll handle all your people even, if you need me to😅 but I really think you're already burnt out, and running on fumes. I know because you're saying things that I was thinking when I was in that state earlier this year. I don't want you to sink ed. I need you. Many other people need you. But also, me or others shouldn't be the reason you're staying above the surface. It should be you. You should stand tall, and proud because of who you are. Because you're a healer, and a listener. There's always gonna be people that come in and out, jobs that change, cities you move to, but through all the ups and downs, you need to remember that the reason you're staying above the waves is because you help people. Because you've been below. And because you don't and can't allow anyone to see the darkness like you've seen it. You're stronger because of it, but you know not everyone can recover from it like we did. We're always working ed, and it's always okay to take a dip. We're human (despite our God complex's) and we fall sometimes. That's why we have eachother, and that's why I'm here for you ♥️ I know you'll be fine ed, because this will pass. You know it will too, but it's okay to be caught in it. Just rest, focus on you for a while, and then come back swinging ♥️ I love you man"

I get that you want to be there for your team, but look at it objectively, if you're already behind schedule, you're underexperienced (i'm assuming from what I read) and the boss creates a toxic environment (that I'm assuming is hard to work in). At this point, the only thing keeping you there is sunk cost fallacy. I know you waant to be there for your team, but would you really rather be there and be a determent because of the environment etc and at the cost of your mental health?\n\nWhat we do is tough ed, and sometimes, we make mistakes. As much as our God complexes don't want us to, we do. No one expects you to be perfect Ed, even though you're the best person I've ever met ❤️ You're not perfect. Neither am I. Christine knows this. I explained a lot to her that you're human, just like her. And I told her tot text you to tell you how she feels because she really wants to talk toyou and have you as her brother again.\nI get that you feel guilty, and that's good, so long as you learn from said guilt. I know you. You'd neve walk away from someone who needed you, unless someone else needed you more, and I think Kathy is still way more unstable than Christine. Be proud tha tyou helped Christine to the point where she can got rhough things in her own for the most part now. Again, I think you need time to fully rest and recover. Be patient with yourself, and don't be so judgemental of yourself❤️Drinking, lashing out, running away are all temporary solutions and you know that. \nTake time off, enjoy summer, frefresh your soul. I think you're severely burnt out ed 😕❤️I wish I was there in person so we could do something together❤️but for now, please rest yourself🙏 and text me if you need anything."

You've been there for me though thick and thin, and there's no one is rather be by my side. I honestly have no idea who or what I'd be if you weren't a part of my life.

Life went by during the days I was away and people moved on without me. Anyway enough about me. I have very fond memories of us spending time together, everything from playing Minecraft to sailing to even spying on Sydney for you. Btw I'd still be your bodyguard if needed 😂 I still look over those mod Bros documents every now and again to remind me of the friends/plans we had.

I’m sad we aren’t close anymore rn but college is always hectic, and with architecture school I’ve barely had time to eat meals in the day :(( but my time management has been getting better and hopefully we can start having some banter again and hangout more this year, if you’re in Hk at all this year we definitely gotta jam. I’m actually in a band in college now and got some new tricks up my sleeve for next time we jam 😉 I’m so glad you decided to choose that career path and glad I could help with that choice, and you equally helped me with growing myself as a person and pushing me to perform at my best, even at times where I don’t believe in myself, and for that I’m forever grateful."

You’re one of the most intelligent and caring of individuals I’ve ever met, and having you as a roommate to absorb wisdom and knowledge by osmosis has been one of the most beneficial things I’ve encountered in my life. \nThe reason why I trust you and open up is simple; you’re one of the best people to do that with, in fact it’s to my detriment not to if I didn’t. This is not something that can be said for a lot of people, making you rare, very rare indeed. Make sure you never lose your self for whatever reason, because the world needs more people like you, and it often will throw all sorts of obstacles at you to make you lose your way.\nI’m glad I can serve as a person that reminds you of who you would like to be, and my role in keeping you sharp. Thank goodness I can be myself and serve a useful purpose, because it’s often I feel that my real self has little value, hence the entire self growth progress this year. You were instrumental in it, I wouldn’t have achieved it without you and Ravi, and I’m grateful.\nAnd likewise, it’s been an awesome year of growth! Let’s tackle the next one serving our respective roles, and may we never forget who we would like to be in the process.\nHappy new decade Edward, and here’s to meaningful and successful years going ahead!"

Your competence, intelligence, wisdom, and charisma are like someone rolled 20s in a d20 dice during charactercreation beofre a campaign, though I know they're forged by fire in your early experienced in life. I hope you're doing alright emotionally because holy crap man, you bring so much good to others.\n\nI'm glad to have met you. It's really just like the movies.

You've alway sbeen so supportive of everything(and tbh, idk how you do o it). Thanks for listening and dealing with my banter/rants! I know it's hard to deal with me but you make it work! You've always made me feel like I'm / my life iworth living (and I'm lowkey crying right now). I'm glad, wait no... grateful as shit that you were on my first Interim ❤️ We've been close for about two years and we already have so many memories ❤️ You already encourage me enough by speaking, but when you text it/ take the extra time, it lowkey makes me cry everytime. This is gonna be it for now, you'll get another one of these (maybe longer) when you graduate! Love you ❤️ \n love, \n lil sis ❤️"

		"quote": "Dear big bro,\nI know you are wondering what this is and hold on because I'm about to tell you. In mindfulness, we watched a video on the science of happiness and while watching it, I was thinking of you because whatever I go through, you are always there to support me. I just wanted to take the time and write, or in this case say it to you, because I wanted to let you nkow. Here it goes: Thank you for being there for me when I needed someone. Thank you for making me smile even when I didn't want to. Thank you for helping me restore my confidence that I still have yet to find. I told you I believe everything happens for a reason and this is one case wehre I think that that statement is most applicable, that being because I could not be more thankful to have such a caring big brother in my life. Even though you've known me since I was 7, I was just your friend's annoying sibling at the time. But fast forward three yeras and we've become so much more. I know I've said this a lot but it is true because I genuinely don't know what I would do without you. Without them, I would be my directionally challenged self trying to get by life. Thank you for checking in with me everyday to make sure I am doing/trying to do better than Christine okay or Christine fine. I know I've said this before but thank you for being my big brother, thank you for havign my back, thank you for being there for me. I know I don't say this all the time, or enough come to think of it, but I really do appreciate having you in my life. You've been there for every one of my performances in the past two years and you still manage to calm me down on the other side of the world. You've really made me question and reflect on my life choices in the past three yeras because I know for a fact that if I, hypothetically, ended my life (which I won't), then you would be the most impacted by it. I definitely wouldn't be me without you. I know I'm just rambling but, and if you haven't gotten the point of this yet, thank you for being there for me no matter what and I love you so much! ❤️ You know you can talk to me abou tanything, anytime.\nLove you,\nLove, baby sis."

		"quote": "Dear Edward,\nI know it's been a while since I last gave you a letter but I thought that it was time I gave you another. First of all, I wanted to say thank you so much for being my big brother. I actually don't know what I'd do without you...Not gonna lie, I'd be more directionally challenged than ever! You've stuck by my side since Freshman year and I can't ever thank you enough. I started out as your friends annoying little sister when we met (when I was just a mere child at the age of 7), but now, I've become your little sister and I wouldn't change it for the world. You've never failed to do a dailly check in for three yeras and I realised that I should've done it as well, but me being me, that kinda fell short. Thank you for being here for me when I needed someone. I know it's definitely not easy to listen to my 24 million problems but you make it work and I'm very grateful and truly amazed. I can truly say that you are the one person who has helped me grow so much (as a person lol not literally). I know that no matter where you are, you'll always support me ❤️. You help me be more open to how I feel about shit, whether it's useless or not, and I know that I can tell you anything without you hardcore judging me. We've been through so much in the past three yeras and it's really helped with out closeness and our bodnd as siblings. Of all my close friends, you are the ONE person I rant to about literallye anything. Thank you for being so trustworthy because without you, I would still have trust issues. Three years have gone by and I don't know how many mental/actual breakdowns I've had, but you've experienced or unconciously experienced my pain. I know you mentioned this in th eletter you gave me at the beginning of the year but when you had your health scare, I was so so so so so so worried that I was gonna lose you. I definitely wasn't ready to lose you at that point. In fact, I don't think I'll ever be ready to lose you. It's been almost a year since you graduated and I've literally missed seeing you in the mornings and squishing my cheeks. Thank you for actually watching my long ass snapchat videos and accepting my various memes. Words cannot describe how much I love having you in my life. I've been knocked down so many times, and it's been quite easy as I am a smol hooman being but you've always reminded me to get back up and be so much stronger than I was before,. I wknow how hard it must be to be everyone's guidance counselor but here's where my advice comes in. I know you love to help people with their issues, BUT you can't be there for everyone 24/7, and I know that, which is why I try to limit how much I go to you because I don't want to add to how much stress you have. You have to remember that you can't help everyone all the time and that you need to take breaks for yourself every once in a while. I know you've had a rocky couple of weeks but you've done so well on pushing through like you taught me. In the end, lol idk, I was tryna sound deep, but whoops that obviously failed. Everything I've done in the past couple of years, I've done with you in mind (besides when I'm breaking down). I wanted to say thank you. Thank you for being the reason I can trust people (especially guys) again. Thank you for being the reason I am able to get closer to others. Anyway, thank you for being the best big brother and believing in me when I didn't., I'm so lucky to have you in my life. I LOVE YOU. \nLove,❤️\nYour directionally challenged baby sister aka Thing 2 akak Younger Lee\nPS: I don't like that I have to share you with other people. NOT FAIR AT ALL 😔"

Knowing without doubt at all times your love for us, as a family, is one thing. Hearing (reading) it is so much more powerful.\nSeeing you and Kevin’s growing up, it always reminds me the power of Nature and Nurture, and the most powerful is You. Nature gives you the quality of empathy and compassion that in many times it may mean a heavy load to carry in life. Nurture gives you the value that dad and I believe in, and providing the opportunities to learn and grow in the past years. Then comes You, who have to decide and walk your own path, setting new values and creating new opportunities. You’ve made choices and become the confident individual as you are today. \nI’m proud of you not because I’m your mom, not just.  I’m proud because you are a respectful, responsible, caring and sincere young man. Future is ahead of you and it’s in your power to make it bright and hopeful, for yourself and for other people.\nWe miss you (and Kevin) so much that many times I wish I’m close by and can give (or need) a hug, but there’s always a trade, the path we’ve chosen always has a price to pay. This is a path we have chosen together and the price is considerably small for this rewarding and extraordinary outcome. \nWe love you immensely, as always. 💕 ❤️"

That said, we ARE proud of you and glad that in your own eyes you share the pride in yourself while remaining humble in your own unique achievements and friendships.  Your life will be a long and interesting journey.  We are very happy to see that you got a good start both in your ‘tools’ and your ‘attitude’ that make you a whole and caring person.  Speaking for myself, I’m very happy about my family individually and collectively and I count myself very lucky.  \nLove, dad"

When I first met you and interacted, I looked at you with jealousy, then respect, envy, and finally inspiration. You forced me to grow and changed how I think, and that's been crazy valuable.\n\nYou still have a lot to teach me and I'm eager to learn, and if along the way I can help you, I'd be bloody glad.

I know that next year's gonna be very different and it seems scary but knowing that you are with me makes that so much easier. In fact, and I know I say this a lot, but it's true, but I don't know where I would be withou tyour words of wisdom and all the advice you've given me this year. Through all the constant roasts, last minute hangouts, you having to explain comic book logic to me because I'm dumb, and your group roasts on me on Facebook (please stop), I'm so thankful to know that you my best interests at heart. You've been an amazing friend this year, and even though we may not fulfill JEVA CHIP, (rather you trying to pick from th eliteral swarm of girls you have while I'm alone af), I hope for many more memories (and less drama and issues) next year.

Took mom to the movies, some running around and shopping and generally exploring a bit of Central we have not seen before. It is not actually that different most of the time as you were out with friends, 'me time', etc., but dinners are a new experience without your contributions.\nThat said, YiYi is here and filling up som eof the gap for now. They have been playing tourist to the giant Buddha, transportation day tour, lunches and today is 'photo sorting day' going through the red box. So, for now - all attention is on Justin instead of me... yay for me and I have absolutely no intention to make any noise that changes that dynamic or focus headed in my direction!! I have been ducking out to fly drones, spend time on the balcony to cook, got a new book to hide away and so on. Young Kung is on his own! And this Sunday, I am sailing - rain or shine and BBQ at MI. \n No surprise, we hit your room somewhat on Sunday since it was raining. Basically, we folded your clothes and q.add drawers, threw away the carpets as old and worn (especially under drums and desk chair) and that's about it. Now I am using your desk and put the printer on your drawers. \nThat allowed mom to generally pack away her work on the dining table daily into the 'box' and also put in your room in the evening - so we moved on and put all the TVs back and had to clean up the living room too. What a productive an dfun weekend.\nWe started 2 new family projects that will soon consume all of our time, \n1. S+ office and home relocation to Sui Sai Wan. It appears that we may have found a unit that will work for us to buy. So we are now working on the real estate part to understand if it works out and then make an offer. If hthis one works out, we may plan to complete renovation and move in December. THe place is about twice as big as Larvotto and high warehouse ceiling etc. so we will see. \n2. GMa relocation to Friendship village. Yes, she made the decision and bought a new smaller house. So that project and move will happen in Jan (say 9-15) Therefore, mom is the remote designer and I am the remote Project Manager for that. I am planning to make a trip in October and will let you know the details. Anyway, you will sure get a couple of free dinners in SF when I come through. \nWe are hoping you are settling in with some routine yet know it will take a while. So here is some taste from home and morning routine to take to those first classes that are such a long walk from your dorm.\n Love Dad."
