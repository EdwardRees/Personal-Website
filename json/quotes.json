Oh my goodness, this is such a huge milestone (even if it may not feel like it in the moment) but I'm soo proud of you for everything you've accomplished and I can't express how grateful that I have you in my life for the long run =) There are so many things that I appreciate about you and our friendship - to name a few .... \n- Daily texts / randomly checking up on each other \n- Spontaneous hangouts\n- Long walks\n- Your hardworking attitude and spirit\n- Your perserverance (spelled dat wrong)\n- the...no filter in our convos\n- your honesty\nand so much more =)\nCOVID was so unexpected and it gave rise to so many challenges - 2020 was rough... but we technically endured a year of uni together and I feel like it definitely strengthened the bond that we have =) no matter how much time goes by, our connection never really changes... It just gets stronger if anything. Our friendship is so valuable and important to me and I promise I'll always be here by your side to take on life's happiest moments and of course all the hardships too. I hope your 21st bday is as SPECIAL and awesome as you are, love ya and happy happy bday <3\n Tree xx"

I'm grateful you bring me sour patch kids whenever you're back from the states (not 1 pack but like 500), that you always walk me to my bus stop and wait for the bus with me after we hang, that you check up on me everyday (and actually care when I'm sick), that we don't consistently use our phones when we're together, and so much more. You're not someone that I feel I have to prove myself to or act a certain way around, you're so incredibly supportive of me in everything that I do and I trust you so so much. Being by your side and just seeing how you treat others, how you forgive even when it's hard to, and how you've grown to prioritize self care (more), makes me genuinely happy.\nKeep being the workaholic that you are, doing what makes you happy, and being around people who are good to you. I'll be there every step of the way, I promise!!\nLove you and I'm so proud of you.\nHappy Birthday hehe\nTheresa xx"

You may or may not be wondering what the purpose of this letter is (idk...up to you) and honestly, idk either. This letter will probably be me just ranting about how grateful I am to have you as an older brother. First of all, I would like to say thank you! Not only for being there for me for the past couple of years, but for also taking care of me. Words can't explain how grateful I am for such a considerate, supportive, and caring older brother.\n*Disclaimer:This letter will have no order/type of organisation whatsoever so this will be a mess but you're used to that as you have been dealing with me for a while.\n\nWe've known of each other's existence for 9 years (so since I was 7? idk) but we've gotten closer over the last two, which I feel is sad. Honestly, I don't know how you've dealt with me and my problems for so long because there is a lot, some of which are very much repeated...actually, all of them are very much repeated, so kudos to you<❤️ I also don't know how you've managed to come to basically all of my performances in the past two years. You've really encouraged me to continue performing and helping me to remember to BREATHE!\n\nYou help me feel needed and loved when I needed to the most. (I can't English...but that's nothing new). You've constantly reminded me that I have a reason to live for the long period of time that I've known you for, you've constantly made sure that I was doing okay. You've helped so many people and you deserve all the recognition that you get, I'm gonna end this letter here by saying a couple of words.\n\n-I'm gonna miss you like crazy\n-idk what I'm gonna do w/o you\n-I'm so lucky to call you my older brother\nand finally...I love you more than words can say and CONGRATULATIONS! You've achieved (idk if that's right) so much and I don't want you to give up! ❤️"

Love you lots too ❤️\n...\nYeah ikr we've been close since like 10th grade but since then, we've been really really close. Like before that, we were just friends. I'm glad we still keep in touch and haven't drifted honestly don't know what I'd do without you either, like we tell each other basically everything."

As I wasn't familiar to the whole American high school system at first, it took a toll on me and I didn't balance out my courses in high school, which results in senior year being filled with very intense courses. I was overwhelmed by all the workload and pressure throughout the year, but I lied to myself and kept it from my friends and family by saying that I was okay. I guess that's one of the reasons I started drifting away from all my friends, I wasn't happy with my performance in classes and I thought maybe just taking my social part away would help the situation, but it got worse and I started getting very depressed and helpless. But even then, you still support me and make sure that I was doing just fine. And that really meant a lot to me, just knowing that you're always there when I needed help. I honestly don't know what would've happened if you weren't actually there for me in my senior year.\nTo be honest, I really hated high school, but you really made it a better place. I hope you know that I will be there if you need someone to talk, and I hope we keep in contact. Thank you for the past three years, I'm looking forward for more years to come ❤️"

		"quote": "ed, you are someone that really tries your best in all types of things and relationships that you do. In this digitalised generation where everyone no longer treasures human connection or takes it for granted, you're one that didn't and that is a great thing in itself, but at the same time with the different ways people treat or handle relationships, you're easily vulnerable due to those treatment.\nThere's gonna be people who do not handle relationships nicely or take peoples kindness for granted, so I understand how you will get drained from putting in all the effort while the other party is solely taking. That is an unfair treatment itself, and if you feel that towards someone for some period, then they might not be treasuring the relationship as much as you do. Talk to them about it, make them understand how you feel and seek a common ground, but if they aren't willing to change, treat it same way as you do, then maybe they aren't people that you should be wasting time on.\nYou're a very kind person ed, and I get that you try to maintain friendships with a lot of different people, but some people are just not worth it and you need to know that. If they bring you down or distance you cause of small matters, take it as a red flag and leave those people, focus on people who are really there for you instead.\nAt the same time, I know it's hard to do in practice, but just try to understand yourself better. Just sit down, and think about your values, what you like or don't like, your boundaries, your goals in life, etc etc. It's important that you learn to love and respect yourself first, so you can protect yourself from mistreatment of other people. Love yourself ed. you're worthy of it.\nI know I'm quite late this time and I couldn't really be there this time but I'm willing to listen and talk ed, don't give up on yourself. You have a lot of great things in you, nkow your worth and leave  people that don't appreciate you behind :)"

		"quote": ":((( i’m so sorry that happened to you\nfor the first part, it’s hard to maintain or work on the friendship if you’re the only one reciprocating and trying to make it work. It goes for all relationships but it takes two to make things work, and you shouldn’t be too harsh on yourself. There might actually be ways to retain those relationships but you’re not the only one contributing to it, if you do really treasure those ppl and desperately want things to work out, you may reach out but sometimes relationships end you might have to accept it the way they are. That’s why we’re here for you ed, there’s definitely ppl like me here that are going to keep supporting you so try to focus on those you really treasure and remind yourself you’re definitely not alone\nfor the second part, some people are just careless with their words and they don’t know that their words might offend you. it might just be genuine curiosity and it can be frustrating for you when people don’t understand. As long as you know what you want and need in life, just try to ignore those comments and focus on yourself\ni relate a lot to the friends situation in the last part, there are people that i would consider as friends but i won’t never be able to engage in heartful conversations or trust with my thoughts. It’s sad honestly but not everyone is genuine and i’ve learnt to differentiate others from my true friends so I would lower my expectations and try not to get disappointed when they do not listen or care the way i do for them. that’s why friends like me are here for you ed, you know you’ll always have me to rely on and support you mentally❤️\nit might be a phase for some people, i definitely wasn’t as wholesome before but as people grow older, they’ll learn that what you did for them is irreplaceable but for now they just don’t understand\nfocus on the people that actually matter in your life or people that actually brings you positive energy, those are the ones that’ll be there when you’re going through though times and friends you’d know would last a lifetime\nnot everyone may understand you but keep the ones that do and you’ll be at a much happier place❤️❤️i hope you’ll be happier as time goes\nit’s cause you understand how important it is to listen and give support to others in need, but some people take your kindness for granted. I know you do enjoy being a counsellor and help others out, but it’s important to take breaks and find yourself someone that is willing listen to you as well. I think it’s cause it has happened to you quite often that makes you feel disappointed when some people aren’t there for you the same way you were there for them, and tbh if that other party keeps draining your energy and keeps abusing your kindness without giving, it’s safe to say that the relationship is toxic and itd be better that you stay out of it until you’re feeling better. There’s definitely people like me that are willing to listen and support you, but it’s not guaranteed that everyone would do the same in return of your support. try to stay away from the people that give you negative energy and recharge yourself from the people that do you good. It’ll definitely help you focus on the good in life and remind you of the support and care you actually deserve❤️\nand honestly don’t beat yourself up for reaching out that’s what friends are actually for, i definitely wouldn’t mind listening  and being there for you when that’s all i can do for you at the moment, we all need that person to support and be there for them when tough times call\nquit the negative ppl out of your life you’re better than that\nor just be mindful that they’re not worth your time being sad over and you’ll definitely save your energy for better things\ni love you and miss you too☺️\n\nit’ll take time to do so, just remember there’s better people out there and you’re not alone❤️"

I’m sorry for hearing that you’re struggling alone in SF but no matter what know I am supportive of you, and there are also people out there that you haven’t met that are worth trusting and relying on, don’t close off yourself just because of the general bad instances you’ve shared with people there, it might be tiresome to start knowing someone anew, but it takes time to have that deep bond that we share. It’s fine if you can’t seek that same comfort from ppl in SF, but don’t bottle up your emotions too much, if you’re burnt out and stressed you can always tell others, they may not be fully supportive but you’d feel less entrapped by the situation and it’ll make it a tiny bit endurable.

But also, me or others shouldn't be the reason you're staying above the surface. It should be you. You should stand tall, and proud because of who you are. Because you're a healer, and a listener. There's always gonna be people that come in and out, jobs that change, cities you move to, but through all the ups and downs, you need to remember that the reason you're staying above the waves is because you help people. Because you've been below. And because you don't and can't allow anyone to see the darkness like you've seen it. You're stronger because of it, but you know not everyone can recover from it like we did. We're always working ed, and it's always okay to take a dip. We're human (despite our God complex's) and we fall sometimes. That's why we have eachother, and that's why I'm here for you ♥️ I know you'll be fine ed, because this will pass.

I never dreamed I'd be as blessed as I am now, from family to friends, there's been so much gain and loss that I literally couldn't recognise myself from back then. I still remember heading into Mrs Gill's bio class all those years ago, and that just so happened to be a day in which she was taking a class photo, but man meeting you and growing close to you has changed my life for the better in such a huge way I couldn't even put it into words. You've been there for me though thick and thin, and there's no one is rather be by my side. I honestly have no idea who or what I'd be if you weren't a part of my life. No amount of distance or change will ever be enough to separate our souls, this year has shown me that, and I'm so absurdly overjoyed at that♥️ you mean the world to me ed, and I don't know what I'd do without you in my life.

You’re one of the most intelligent and caring of individuals I’ve ever met, and having you as a roommate to absorb wisdom and knowledge by osmosis has been one of the most beneficial things I’ve encountered in my life. \nThe reason why I trust you and open up is simple; you’re one of the best people to do that with, in fact it’s to my detriment not to if I didn’t. This is not something that can be said for a lot of people, making you rare, very rare indeed. Make sure you never lose your self for whatever reason, because the world needs more people like you, and it often will throw all sorts of obstacles at you to make you lose your way.\nI’m glad I can serve as a person that reminds you of who you would like to be, and my role in keeping you sharp. Thank goodness I can be myself and serve a useful purpose, because it’s often I feel that my real self has little value, hence the entire self growth progress this year. You were instrumental in it, I wouldn’t have achieved it without you and Ravi, and I’m grateful.\nAnd likewise, it’s been an awesome year of growth! Let’s tackle the next one serving our respective roles, and may we never forget who we would like to be in the process.\nHappy new decade Edward, and here’s to meaningful and successful years going ahead!"

You're a rock I can count on, a beacon I can strive towards, and a role model I emulate. Without you dude, I realy would have no idea whether I'd have gone through the first semester of college intact with the emotional turmoil caused by life and a certain flower....\n\nI've often cited why I look up to you but I'm doing it again lah. Your competence, intelligence, wisdom, and charisma are like someone rolled 20s in a d20 dice during charactercreation before a campaign, though I know they're forged by fire in your early experienced in life. I hope you're doing alright emotionally because holy crap man, you bring so much good to others.\n\nI'm glad to have met you. It's really just like the movies. Now I hope both the mentor and the student can get what they want instead of the classic mentor dying off and passing the torch or something like that (Obi Wan, Count of Monte Cristo), I'd want better faces for us than that.\n\nHappy new year from Indonesia."

There have been so many times you've helped pull me out of making stupid decisions and have helped me rationalize because I always do let my emotions control my actions. As always, you know you can always come to me as well. No matter how many fights we have, we still somehow always manage to work it out because our friendship is too strong to give up. So glad we are still just as close as before in Uni, and I hope we continue to stay close. 2018 has been an amazing year, and 2019 will be even better! Thanks for being such a big part of my year Ed.

It's crazy to think about how much I've learned, and so much of what you taught in cs110 has made my swift ventures possible.

In mindfulness, we watched a video on the science of happiness and while watching it, I was thinking of you because whatever I go through, you are always there to support me. I just wanted to take the time and write, or in this case say it to you, because I wanted to let you nkow. Here it goes: Thank you for being there for me when I needed someone. Thank you for making me smile even when I didn't want to. Thank you for helping me restore my confidence that I still have yet to find. I told you I believe everything happens for a reason and this is one case wehre I think that that statement is most applicable, that being because I could not be more thankful to have such a caring big brother in my life. Even though you've known me since I was 7, I was just your friend's annoying sibling at the time. But fast forward three years and we've become so much more. I know I've said this a lot but it is true because I genuinely don't know what I would do without you. Without them, I would be my directionally challenged self trying to get by life. Thank you for checking in with me everyday to make sure I am doing/trying to do better than Christine okay or Christine fine. I know I've said this before but thank you for being my big brother, thank you for havign my back, thank you for being there for me. I know I don't say this all the time, or enough come to think of it, but I really do appreciate having you in my life. You've been there for every one of my performances in the past two years and you still manage to calm me down on the other side of the world. You've really made me question and reflect on my life choices in the past three yeras because I know for a fact that if I, hypothetically, ended my life (which I won't), then you would be the most impacted by it. I definitely wouldn't be me without you. I know I'm just rambling but, and if you haven't gotten the point of this yet, thank you for being there for me no matter what and I love you so much! ❤️ You know you can talk to me abou tanything, anytime.\nLove you,\nLove, baby sis."

First of all, I wanted to say thank you so much for being my big brother. I actually don't know what I'd do without you...Not gonna lie, I'd be more directionally challenged than ever! You've stuck by my side since Freshman year and I can't ever thank you enough. I started out as your friends annoying little sister when we met (when I was just a mere child at the age of 7), but now, I've become your little sister and I wouldn't change it for the world. You've never failed to do a daily check in for three years and I realised that I should've done it as well, but me being me, that kinda fell short. Thank you for being here for me when I needed someone. I know it's definitely not easy to listen to my 24 million problems but you make it work and I'm very grateful and truly amazed. I can truly say that you are the one person who has helped me grow so much (as a person lol not literally). I know that no matter where you are, you'll always support me ❤️. You help me be more open to how I feel about shit, whether it's useless or not, and I know that I can tell you anything without you hardcore judging me. We've been through so much in the past three yeras and it's really helped with out closeness and our bodnd as siblings. Of all my close friends, you are the ONE person I rant to about literally anything. Thank you for being so trustworthy because without you, I would still have trust issues. Three years have gone by and I don't know how many mental/actual breakdowns I've had, but you've experienced or unconciously experienced my pain. I know you mentioned this in the letter you gave me at the beginning of the year but when you had your health scare, I was so so so so so so worried that I was gonna lose you. I definitely wasn't ready to lose you at that point. In fact, I don't think I'll ever be ready to lose you. It's been almost a year since you graduated and I've literally missed seeing you in the mornings and squishing my cheeks. Thank you for actually watching my long ass snapchat videos and accepting my various memes. Words cannot describe how much I love having you in my life. I've been knocked down so many times, and it's been quite easy as I am a smol hooman being but you've always reminded me to get back up and be so much stronger than I was before,. I wknow how hard it must be to be everyone's guidance counselor but here's where my advice comes in. I know you love to help people with their issues, BUT you can't be there for everyone 24/7, and I know that, which is why I try to limit how much I go to you because I don't want to add to how much stress you have. You have to remember that you can't help everyone all the time and that you need to take breaks for yourself every once in a while. I know you've had a rocky couple of weeks but you've done so well on pushing through like you taught me. In the end, lol idk, I was tryna sound deep, but whoops that obviously failed. Everything I've done in the past couple of years, I've done with you in mind (besides when I'm breaking down). I wanted to say thank you. Thank you for being the reason I can trust people (especially guys) again. Thank you for being the reason I am able to get closer to others. Anyway, thank you for being the best big brother and believing in me when I didn't., I'm so lucky to have you in my life. I LOVE YOU. \nLove,❤️\nYour directionally challenged baby sister aka Thing 2 akak Younger Lee\nPS: I don't like that I have to share you with other people. NOT FAIR AT ALL 😔"

Nature gives you the quality of empathy and compassion that in many times it may mean a heavy load to carry in life. Nurture gives you the value that dad and I believe in, and providing the opportunities to learn and grow in the past years. Then comes You, who have to decide and walk your own path, setting new values and creating new opportunities. You’ve made choices and become the confident individual as you are today. \nI’m proud of you not because I’m your mom, not just.  I’m proud because you are a respectful, responsible, caring and sincere young man. Future is ahead of you and it’s in your power to make it bright and hopeful, for yourself and for other people.\nWe miss you (and Kevin) so much that many times I wish I’m close by and can give (or need) a hug, but there’s always a trade, the path we’ve chosen always has a price to pay. This is a path we have chosen together and the price is considerably small for this rewarding and extraordinary outcome. \nWe love you immensely, as always. 💕 ❤️"

Of course we talked and have reflected ourselves on what WE set out do do as we established a young family and continually worked on it with you and Kevin until now.    That said, we ARE proud of you and glad that in your own eyes you share the pride in yourself while remaining humble in your own unique achievements and friendships.  Your life will be a long and interesting journey.  We are very happy to see that you got a good start both in your ‘tools’ and your ‘attitude’ that make you a whole and caring person.  Speaking for myself, I’m very happy about my family individually and collectively and I count myself very lucky.  \nLove, dad"

My PC is still named Eick (lul) and I am honoured to be a co-leader of our sailing club  🙂 we should also start on an email for sailing club before we get back."

It has been so nice that we finally got to reconnect after so many years and you are so freaking smart and genuine. I just kno wyou're going to do amazing things in life. You've already started creating apps and have the best conversations that a lot of people just can't do. Thank you so much for always supporting me and always seeing the positives.

Your wisdom and intelligence (or competence, as I'd personally like to think recently) also set standards for the kind fo person I aspire to be. When I first met you and interacted, I looked at you with jealousy, then respect, envy, and finally inspiration. You forced me to grow and changed how I think, and that's been crazy valuable.\n\nYou still have a lot to teach me and I'm eager to learn, and if along the way I can help you, I'd be bloody glad. So yeah, thanks for being you as well. You bring good to everyone around you, so continue being the Yoda you are (and I hope I don't end up like Dooku). See you around!"

From Jam sessions, to lunches together, to my post-being drunk rants and calls to you, and esp my dumb decisions at times, you have always been there for me through thick and thin this year, through rain and shine, and I can't thank you enough for that. I know that next year's gonna be very different and it seems scary but knowing that you are with me makes that so much easier. In fact, and I know I say this a lot, but it's true, but I don't know where I would be without your words of wisdom and all the advice you've given me this year. Through all the constant roasts, last minute hangouts, you having to explain comic book logic to me because I'm dumb, and your group roasts on me on Facebook (please stop), I'm so thankful to know that you my best interests at heart. You've been an amazing friend this year, and even though we may not fulfill JEVA CHIP, (rather you trying to pick from the literal swarm of girls you have while I'm alone af), I hope for many more memories (and less drama and issues) next year. I'm here for you and you that, and it comforts me to know that you'll always be here for me too (I hope). Love you long time ed, wo ai ni de bu de liao"

You stepped up every day and everyone walked away feeling cared for, listened to, and valued. It's not easy to lead like this but you have a natural way of doing it, so I hope that you will find opportunities to continue in the future.\n\nI couldn't believe how hard everyone worked throughout the entire week! You were doing every task, encouraging everyone to work hard through your example and warm conversations. And of course you smile, which you wore throughout the week.\nI can't tell you how pleased I was to go on this experience with you and to see you blossom and help others blossom.\nYour aunt must be so proud to watch you do what you did.\nBest,\nMrs. Chi and Mr. Canham"

		"quote": "Dear Edward\nYes, we are missing you here in HK. Some days are quite quiet and I am working pretty hard to fill in the time. Took mom to the movies, some running around and shopping and generally exploring a bit of Central we have not seen before. It is not actually that different most of the time as you were out with friends, 'me time', etc., but dinners are a new experience without your contributions.\nThat said, YiYi is here and filling up som eof the gap for now. They have been playing tourist to the giant Buddha, transportation day tour, lunches and today is 'photo sorting day' going through the red box. So, for now - all attention is on Justin instead of me... yay for me and I have absolutely no intention to make any noise that changes that dynamic or focus headed in my direction!! I have been ducking out to fly drones, spend time on the balcony to cook, got a new book to hide away and so on. Young Kung is on his own! And this Sunday, I am sailing - rain or shine and BBQ at MI. \n No surprise, we hit your room somewhat on Sunday since it was raining. Basically, we folded your clothes and q.add drawers, threw away the carpets as old and worn (especially under drums and desk chair) and that's about it. Now I am using your desk and put the printer on your drawers. \nThat allowed mom to generally pack away her work on the dining table daily into the 'box' and also put in your room in the evening - so we moved on and put all the TVs back and had to clean up the living room too. What a productive an dfun weekend.\nWe started 2 new family projects that will soon consume all of our time, \n1. S+ office and home relocation to Sui Sai Wan. It appears that we may have found a unit that will work for us to buy. So we are now working on the real estate part to understand if it works out and then make an offer. If hthis one works out, we may plan to complete renovation and move in December. THe place is about twice as big as Larvotto and high warehouse ceiling etc. so we will see. \n2. GMa relocation to Friendship village. Yes, she made the decision and bought a new smaller house. So that project and move will happen in Jan (say 9-15) Therefore, mom is the remote designer and I am the remote Project Manager for that. I am planning to make a trip in October and will let you know the details. Anyway, you will sure get a couple of free dinners in SF when I come through. \nWe are hoping you are settling in with some routine yet know it will take a while. So here is some taste from home and morning routine to take to those first classes that are such a long walk from your dorm.\n Love Dad."
